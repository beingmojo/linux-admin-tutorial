1. The default shell in linux is bash (Bourne-Again Shell).

2. The default shell can be changed to desired one for any individual users
in the /etc/passwd file.

3. Different kind of shells:
(I)  bash :default shell, abbreviation for Bourne-Again Shell.
(II) dash :simpler shell with fewer features than bash, but faster.
(III)tcsh :enhanced version of Unix C shell.
(IV) zsh  :sophiticated shell, similar to korn shell.

4. All these shells are configured in /bin directory.

5. Most direct way to change the default to any of these shells is to 
change the default shell in the /etc/passwd file.
For example, the line that applies to any regular account,
mojo:x:1000:1000:mojo:/home/mojo:/bin/bash
To change the default to dash shell, change /bin/bash to /bin/dash

6. Difference between regular and administrative users.
Two basic prompts are available.

Any prompt with a $ symbol at the end, for example,
[mojo@localhost ~]$
is a standard regular user account.

Any prompt with a # symbol at the end, for example,
[root@localhost mojo]#
is a root administrative user for the same system.
