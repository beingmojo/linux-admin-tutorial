1. Lets do systemctl on remote server
systemctl get-default

The screen prints: 
multi-user.target
This allows us to configure multiusers.

If you do the same command on local machine, you 'll see
graphical.target

2. How to switch users in a system?
su root
This will change the user to root, but will not load the profile 
 customization file of root.

3. There are two kinds of shells in a system.
(I)  interactive shell :Its a interactive shell if you are typing at the
 command prompt.
(II) login shell :This specifies loading custom environment variable and a 
specific customization file.

4. What is .bash_profile?
.bash_profile is a customization script for the login shell.

So, everything inside of .bash_profile gets executed when login shell loads.

5. Every user and root of the system has one .bash_profile .

6. Lets try to edit .bash_profile ,
cd /home/user
vi .bash_profile

echo "you have entered the LOGIN shell."

save and exit.

7. How to login to a login shell?
su -
dash represents login shell
OR
su --login

As you login in to 'su -' you'll see the echo message that we added to the 
.bash_profile file earlier. 

8. If you want to login to root user and keep customization same as regular user than do 
su
If you want to load everything inside .bash_profile, customization of 
.bash_profile, do this,
su -

9. Looking inside .bash_profile
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
This is your PATH environment variable.
Now everything inside your path environment variable allows you to run it
as excecutable without requiring a absolute path of the location.

9. If you do this,
which ls
you'll see this,
/usr/bin/ls
This is the absolute path of ls program.
But ls works regardless whether you give its absolute path everytime.
This is because /usr/bin is added inside our path environment variable.

echo $PATH
This is your environment variable,
You'll see /usr/bin
So environment PATH variable can be customized.

10. File .bash_profile is executed whenever we are in login shell.

11. File .bashrc is executed whenever we are in interactive shell.

12. Global bash profile customization script,
cd /etc
ls -l | grep profile
You'll see file 'profile'
This file is global customization script file.

13. This means that this file gets executed whenever any user logs into the 
system.

14. Also keep in mind that each user still have their own .bash_profile file.
