grep command uses a search term to look through a file. 
It returns the full line that contains the search term.

egrep command or extented grep command is more extension of grep utility.

egrep allows the use of regular expression to search.

character such as the following:
+ :addition symbol
? :question mark
| :pipe symbol or used as OR symbol in programming languages like java, javascript, or cpp.
() :parenthesis

If you plan on searching for any of above character special characters from 
a grep command than make sure to use the escape character which is / :backslash character.

example 1.
grep '^#' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
in this command ^ symbol means search for term which starts with the following character.
So in this example, search file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config and command will search anything which starts with symbol #. 
In linux any thing that starts with a # character is considered a comment.

example 2.
grep -i 'rsaauth' /etc/ssh/ssh_config
In this example -i flag means that search case insensitive meaning regardless
of case search for the given search term.

example 3. 
grep 'user' /etc/passwd
This is simple search of user word in /etc/passwd.

example 4.
grep -v '^#' file1
In this example -v flag means display the inverse of whatever follow.
Here the command will print all that does not start with # character. 
Because the command ask for anything starting with # character however we have a -v flag in place so only inverse following command will print.


example 5.
grep 'world$' file1
This command prints anything that ends with word 'world'.
Because the search term is followed by $ (dollar) character.

example 6.
grep -i '^apple$' file1
This command searches for anything that start and ends with the word 'apple'.
Search results will be displayed both from uppercase and lowercase because of -i flag.

example 7.
grep [aA]pple file1
This means search anything which start with 'a' or 'A' and followed up with term pple.

example 8.
grep '^[aA]pple' file1
This is again the same thing meaning print anything starting a or A.

example 9. 
grep '[^linux]admin' file1
When there is a '^' carrot symbol inside '[]' square brackets, it means that print anything that doesn't match this.
Hence the meaning of ^ symbol is opposite when it appears inside the square brackets[].
In other if ^ appears with [], print the inverse of what follows what ^ within [].

extended grep or egrep command examples.
egrep can also be used as 'grep -E' when in commands. 
example 10.
grep -E '(a)+' file1
Here -E is for extended grep, + means preciding element is used one or more times.

example 11.
grep 'a...e' file1
Every period basically represents a character. 
So search anything that start with a and has three more characters, and ends with a.
Those three characters can be anything.

example 12.
grep 'nologin' /etc/passwd
Search for term 'nologin'.

example 13. 
grep systemd /var/log/messages
This search for term 'systemd' within file at /var/log/messages .

example 14.
grep systemd /var/log/messages | grep 'suspend'
The symbol '|' is pipe symbol. 
Here this means that pipe the results or previous command through what follows after | symbol.
Hence, results of previous command are passed through second grep command, 
which is search for term 'suspend'. 

example 15. 
grep systemd /var/log/messages | grep 'desktop'
This basically the same as example 14. 
This means search for term 'systemd' in /var/log/messages and pass those 
second grep command, which is search for term 'desktop'.

example 16.
cat /var/log/messages | grep 'desktop'
The point of this example is to show that you can show any command with 
| pipe symbol not just grep.
This command print everything from /var/log/messages with 'desktop' in it.
