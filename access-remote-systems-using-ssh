1. The standard RHEL 7 leaves port 22 open for SSH access.
Related configuration files are at /etc/ssh directory.

2. Main ssh client configuration file is /etc/ssh/ssh_config . Individual 
users can have custom SSH client configurations in their ~/.ssh/config files.

3. Accessing remote server using another remote server.
First lets access first remote server,
ssh user@54.214.180.149
Now, lets login to another server from above remote server,
ssh user@34.211.144.147

4. Transfering files with ssh.
All these tools can be used,
(I)  scp :secure copy protocol,
(II) ssh :secure shell,
(III)sftp:secure file transfer protocol,

5. Using scp,
scp file1 user@54.214.180.149:~/
The last part after : signifies the destination address, here it means destination user  home directory.
This transfered file1 from one remote server to another.

6. Using sftp,
lets download files from remote server, this can be done using scp as well.

sftp user@34.211.144.147
You'll get sftp prompt like this,
sftp> 
Here you can perform various linux commands.

get file2
This will download the file2 to server you are logged on.

put file1
This will upload the file1 from current server to remote server.

You can create directory using sftp on remore server,
sftp> mkdir test

sftp> bye
quit sftp

sftp> quit
quit sftp

7. If you want to issue a command on remote machine, 
You can search that from history of ssh, by hitting Ctrl+r and type ssh,
look through commands and select one.

8. Let enter the /etc/ssh
vi sshd_config

look for this line,
#PermitRootLogin yes
This means that you can login as root user to the remote system.
This is right commented as there is a # character in front of the line.
This is security hole and a bad practice.

9. Now if you were to uncomment no change it to No, 

Once you change the configurations, you'll perform,

systemctl restart sshd

that'll apply that change.

10. Now if you have to issue some command to the remote system directly
without actually connecting to that server.

ssh user@54.214.180.149 ls -l

This will list the home directory of remote server.
